The actual test failure is due to a **mobile sidebar state management issue** in the application.\n\n### Root Cause\nThe mobile sidebar Dialog component fails to mount properly when clicking the 'Open sidebar' button:\n- **HeadlessUI FocusTrap warning**: 'There are no focusable elements inside the \u003cFocusTrap /\u003e'\n- The sidebar Dialog doesn't render in the DOM even after clicking the button\n- React state updates appear to not be triggering properly\n\n### Test Failures\nBoth Chromium (Pixel 4) and WebKit (iPhone 11) fail with timeout errors:\n1. **Pixel 4**: Timeout waiting for navigation after clicking the logout button\n2. **iPhone 11**: Timeout trying to click the 'Keluar' button - element never becomes visible\n\nDesktop browsers (Firefox, Safari) and noscript mode pass because they use the always-visible desktop sidebar.\n\n### Key Findings\n- The 'Open sidebar' button click is registered by the browser\n- React event handlers are attached properly\n- The issue appears to be a **React hydration mismatch** between server-rendered and client-rendered HTML\n- This is a **blocking issue** in the application code, not a Playwright/E2E test issue\n\n### Recommendation\nThis task is actually about a **mobile sidebar component bug**, not the Playwright installation. The E2E test is correctly exposing the bug. The real fix requires:\n1. Debugging why the mobile sidebar Dialog fails to mount\n2. Investigating React hydration/state management in the Dashboard component\n3. Testing with React DevTools to confirm state updates are happening\n\nThis should be tracked as a separate application bug rather than a CI/E2E infrastructure issue.","created_at":"2026-01-01T08:16:06Z"}]}
