## Principles

## Guidelines

In general, these are three guidelines that we need to pay attention to:

1. [Query priorities](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about#priority)
2. [Testing appearance and disappearance](https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-disappearance/)
3. [Opting in for interactions instead of events](https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-events/#interactions-vs-events)
   (if possible)

Please ensure that all queries and assertions in your test files comply with
those testing guidelines.
